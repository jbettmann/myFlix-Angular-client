# MyFlixAngularClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.6.

## Description

Using the myFlix REST API build in a [previous project](https://github.com/jbettmann/myFlix-app), this client
side version of the myFlix App was build with Angular. Users are
directed to a welcome screen where they have the options of logging
in or signing up. Once logged in and upon clicking on a particular
movie, users are taken to a single movie view, where additional
movie details are displayed. A profile view is also available for the user to view, update or delete account. The entire UI of the app was designed with Angular Materials. Documentation for the project was generated with TypeDoc.
